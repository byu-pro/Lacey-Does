Visual style
Style/theme ideas
The site should feel clean, bold, bright, and personality-forward. Lacey’s vibe is vibrant, loud, “maximalist”, and all about storytelling. Entertainment and education are the drivers, using social media as a portfolio platform to grow a community.
Fonts:
MAIN FONT: Awesome
Use the italic version to emphasize certain words. There are many weights of this font, but always stick to using bold or regular.
SUB-FONT: STEVIE SANS
This can be used for subheadings or when a cleaner look is needed. Choose a weight that does not overpower the Awesome font.

This is a personal brand site, not a traditional portfolio

The tone should feel human, confident, and collaborative
